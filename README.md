![Scan Dashboard](/Users/benelux/.gemini/antigravity/brain/7364dad3-fd34-436e-ac18-cd1abec32683/turbo_broccoli_scan_results_1768409660261.png)

## 📌 Problem

Students and early-stage startups often ship fast and break rules. Common mistakes include:
- Committing `.env` files or API keys.
- Misconfiguring JWTs (using `none` alg or weak secrets).
- Leaving CORS wide open (`*`).
- Exposing admin routes without protection.

turbo broccoli acts as a **last-mile security checkpoint** that catches these issues, explains how to exploit them, and offers one-click fixes.

## 🚀 Features

-   **🔍 Deep Repository Scan**: Analyzes source code for 5+ critical vulnerability patterns.
-   **😈 Exploit Simulation**: Demonstrates *impact* by forging tokens (JWT) and testing access controls.
-   **🤖 Auto-Fix PRs**: One-click generation of Pull Requests to patch vulnerabilities (Simulated in MVP).
-   **📊 Premium Dashboard**: A developer-friendly UI to view risks and mitigation steps.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS 4, Lucide Icons
-   **Backend Logic**: Node.js, `glob`, Regex, AST-like parsing
-   **Simulation**: `jsonwebtoken`, `axios` for exploit scripts

## ⚡ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mock-org/turbo-broccoli.git
cd turbo-broccoli
npm install
```

### 2. Configuration

Copy the example env file (or use the one provided):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure `.env` has:
```env
GITHUB_ORG=your-org
SCAN_TARGET_DIR=.
```

### 3. Run the Dashboard

```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### 4. Run the Exploit Demo

To see the "Hacker View" in the terminal:

```bash
npx tsx src/exploit/index.ts
```

## 🧪 How to Verify (Demo Flow)

1.  **Open Dashboard**: Go to `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Scan**: Click **"Run Scan"**.
3.  **View Results**: You should see 12+ vulnerabilities found in `src/vulnerable_app_test.ts`.
4.  **Check Details**: Expand the "AWS Access Key" card.
5.  **Auto-Fix**: Click the **"Auto-Fix"** button.
    -   *Success*: receive an alert with a Mock PR URL.
    -   *Check*: Verify `turbo-broccoli-patch-....diff` was created in the project root.

## 🛡️ Supported Checks (MVP)

| ID | Description | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `exposed-secrets` | Hardcoded API Keys/Secrets | CRITICAL |
| `jwt-misconfig` | 'None' Algorithm or Weak Secrets | CRITICAL |
| `broken-cors` | Wildcard Origin (`*`) | HIGH |
| `admin-route` | Unprotected API Routes | HIGH |
